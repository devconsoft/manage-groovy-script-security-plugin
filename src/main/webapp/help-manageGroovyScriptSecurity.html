    Generally speaking, disabling security is always a bad idea. Especially if done
    out of ignorance. Please, only use these options as a last resort and on private
    jenkins instances not available to the public
    (including but not limited to being exposed to the Internet).<br />
    <br />
    However, there are a few use cases when disabling security might be warranted.
    <ul>
    <li>Managing configuration via the file-system: if you deploy your configuration
    via the file system rather than via the web GUI, such as automated or scripted
    deployment, you might need to lacken the security to fully automate the process.
    </li>
    <li>
    Generating configuration via plugins such as job DSL. Spawning jobs with
    unique configuration might result in hundreds of unique scripts needing
    approval, making it infeasible to use the manual approval mechanisms.
    </li>
    </ul>
