    WARNING: Enabling this option disables all groovy script sandbox security!
    <p>
    When activated, this option will bypass the script sandbox security mechanism by
    treating all calls as if they  where white-listed.
    The plugin does not modify the approved white-list, and the effects of
    the plugin is hence immediately reverted when
    disabling the option in the system configuration, or when uninstalling the plugin.
    <p/>
    <p>
    See the
    <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Script+Security+Plugin">wiki</a>
    for the Script security plugin to learn more how the sandbox mechanism works.
